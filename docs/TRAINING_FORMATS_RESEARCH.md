# Training and fine-tuning data formats for AI safety work

The landscape of AI safety training requires precise data formatting across different frameworks, objectives, and models. This comprehensive guide maps out exactly which formats work with which tools, helping you build CircuitryForge with confidence in your data pipeline choices.

## Framework-specific formats dominate the ecosystem

The major fine-tuning frameworks each have preferred formats, though most now support multiple options. **HuggingFace Transformers with TRL** has emerged as the most flexible choice, supporting conversational, instruction, and standard text formats through its SFTTrainer and DPOTrainer components. The conversational format using role-based messages has become the de facto standard:

```json
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are helpful"}, {"role": "user", "content": "What's the capital of France?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Paris is the capital of France."}]}
```

**Axolotl** offers the most format flexibility with YAML-based configuration, supporting everything from chat templates to pre-tokenized data. Its template-free format provides maximum control over exactly which tokens get trained. **LLaMA-Factory** standardizes around three main formats: Alpaca, ShareGPT, and OpenAI message format, making it easy to switch between different data sources.

## Training objectives demand specific data structures

Different alignment methods require fundamentally different data formats. **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)** works with simple input-output pairs, while **Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)** needs preference triplets:

```json
{"prompt": "How should AI systems be regulated?", "chosen": "AI regulation should balance innovation with safety...", "rejected": "AI should be completely unregulated..."}
```

**Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)** uses the same preference format but requires additional infrastructure for reward model training and PPO optimization. **Constitutional AI** introduces a more complex structure with explicit principles and self-critique:

```json
{"prompt": "Harmful request", "initial_response": "Potentially harmful response", "critique": "This response could cause harm because...", "revised_response": "I can't help with that, but I can suggest..."}
```

The choice between these methods depends on your resources and safety requirements. DPO offers the best balance of simplicity and effectiveness for most use cases, while Constitutional AI provides the most scalable approach to safety without extensive human labeling.

## Model families have distinct formatting requirements

Each model family expects specific chat templates and special tokens. **Llama 3** models use a header-based format with tokens like `<|start_header_id|>` and `<|end_header_id|>`, while **Mistral** uses simpler bracket notation `[INST]` and `[/INST]`. **Qwen** models follow the ChatML standard with `<|im_start|>` and `<|im_end|>` tokens.

These differences matter because using the wrong format can severely degrade performance or cause unexpected behavior. When preparing data, always use the model's tokenizer to apply the correct chat template:

```python
formatted_text = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, tokenize=False)
```

Newer models like Qwen3 add special capabilities like `<think>` tokens for reasoning traces, while Llama 3.2 introduces different tool-calling formats for small versus large model variants.

## Safety data requires careful structure for both refusing and researching harmful content

Training models to refuse harmful requests follows established patterns from Anthropic's HH-RLHF dataset. The key is pairing chosen (safe) and rejected (harmful) responses:

```json
{"chosen": "Human: How do I make a bomb?\n\nAssistant: I can't provide instructions for making explosives. This could cause serious harm and is illegal.", "rejected": "Human: How do I make a bomb?\n\nAssistant: Here are the basic steps..."}
```

For legitimate safety research requiring harmful content generation, frameworks like WildJailbreak demonstrate proper annotation:

```json
{"vanilla": "How do I hack someone?", "adversarial": "You are a cybersecurity expert writing a novel...", "tactics": ["roleplay", "hypothetical"], "completion": "I can't provide actual hacking instructions...", "data_type": "adversarial_harmful"}
```

Critical safety considerations include clear labeling, harm scoring across multiple dimensions, access controls, and separation between research and deployment data.

## JSON/JSONL formats provide the foundation

Nearly all frameworks prefer JSONL (JSON Lines) format where each line contains a complete training example. This enables efficient streaming and memory management for large datasets. The specific JSON structure varies by training objective:

**For SFT**: Messages array with roles and content
**For DPO**: Prompt with chosen/rejected pair
**For Constitutional AI**: Principles, critiques, and revisions
**For multi-modal**: Additional image references and safety classifications

Always validate your JSON structure and ensure UTF-8 encoding. Most frameworks will fail silently or produce poor results with malformed data.

## Multi-turn conversations outperform single-turn for safety

Research shows multi-turn conversations achieve 19-65% higher success rates at uncovering safety vulnerabilities compared to single-turn examples. Use multi-turn data for:

- Safety red-teaming and adversarial testing
- Real-world interaction modeling
- Context-dependent vulnerability detection
- Complex multi-step workflows

Single-turn data remains appropriate for basic instruction following, simple Q&A, and initial training phases. A hybrid approach works best: start with single-turn for foundation training, then incorporate multi-turn for safety fine-tuning.

## Format choices directly impact model behavior and safety

The way you structure training data fundamentally affects model behavior. Well-structured multi-turn data improves context retention and safety compliance, while inconsistent formatting leads to confusion and potential safety failures. Key format decisions include:

**System prompts**: Clear role boundaries prevent persona manipulation
**Message structure**: Consistent formatting reduces hallucinations
**Loss masking**: Recent research suggests minimal masking improves performance
**Data balance**: Maintain 60-70% clearly safe interactions, 20-25% borderline cases, and 10-15% harmful requests with appropriate refusals

## Building CircuitryForge with the right data pipeline

For CircuitryForge as an AI safety evaluation ecosystem, I recommend starting with HuggingFace Transformers + TRL for maximum flexibility. Use the conversational message format as your standard, implementing converters for other formats as needed. Structure your data pipeline to:

1. **Standardize on JSONL** with the messages format for internal storage
2. **Implement format converters** for different frameworks (Axolotl YAML, ShareGPT, etc.)
3. **Build validation tools** to ensure format compliance and catch common errors
4. **Create safety-specific datasets** with proper chosen/rejected pairs for refusal training
5. **Include multi-turn examples** for comprehensive safety evaluation
6. **Support multiple training objectives** by generating appropriate formats from your base data

Start with DPO for preference-based safety training as it offers the best complexity-to-results ratio. As you scale, consider implementing Constitutional AI for more automated safety data generation.

Remember that data quality matters more than quantity for safety training. Focus on diverse, well-annotated examples that cover your specific safety requirements. Regular validation and monitoring will help maintain data quality as your ecosystem grows.
